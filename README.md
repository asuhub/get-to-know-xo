## Welcome to my codeChallenge!

[Visit the live site hosted on Heroku](https://silent-salutations.herokuapp.com/)

First and foremost - thank you for considering me for this once in a lifetime position.
If you have any questions about the app, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly at stephanie.manwaring@gmail.com

This code challenge is a small crud app where you can:
* view people in the codeChallenge database (each person has an id, name, and favorite city)
* edit a person in codeChallengethe database 
* add people to the codeChallenge database
* query people in the codeChallenge database by Id

### About the app

codeChallenge by Stephanie Manwaring is built using the NERDS stack (Node.js, Express, React, Database-Sequelize).

It is a responsive deskop application. 

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following:

[Node.js (>6.7) and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (be sure this is up and running when you launch)

### Running Locally

```
npm install

```
This will install all runtime dependencies, as well as Webpack build and Mocha/Chai/Enzyme testing tools.

Also, make sure to populate the proper environment variables for your local setup!


## Running the app

There are two ways to run the app in development mode:

```
npm run build-watch
npm run dev

```
The first command will run Webpack in watch mode, rebuilding the client static files in '/public' every time a change is made to the source files. The second command will run the Node.js server in development mode.


### Testing
To run the test suite, execute the command **npm test**
